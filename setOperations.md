# Set Operations

In this section, We will learn about the operations on Set result. They are union, intersection and except. They are the general concept in Math.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_a
UNION
SELECT * FROM table_b;
```
The UNION operator removes all duplicate rows from the combined data set. To retain the duplicate rows, you use the the UNION ALL instead.

Simaliar to intersection and except, We use the INTERSECTION, EXCEPT instead.
