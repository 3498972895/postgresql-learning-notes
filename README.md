# Postgresql knowledges Review

The all the files of markdown is writen by myself accrording to the [Postgresql tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/).

And If you are learning the postgresql, there has one book named ***practical SQL 2End*** could helps you. 
Because it teachs you from a beginner level and takes you into different parts of postgresql. 
It's also not necessary reading it by page number. 
My advice from my experience is that practice is first and most of times the Postgresql tutorial is enough for you.

Here you should notice that the all markdown files are writen from web developer perspective.
